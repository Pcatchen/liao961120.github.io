# Evolutionary Pathway of Sex
## Prokaryotes (HGT)
### Eukaryotes 
#### Isogamy
##### Anisogamy
###### Asexual reproduction: due to costs of sex

# Reproduction
## Sexual (Amphimixis)
Amphimixis: Fusion of gametes from two organism.
### Isogamy
#### Fusing gametes are of equal size.
### Anisogamy (def. male/female)
#### Fusing gametes are of unequal size.

## Asexual
### Apomixis
#### Offspring produced by single mitosis: genetically identical to mother.
### Automixis
#### Normal meiosis, offspring produced by fusion of two pronuclei: may be genetically different from mother.
### Parthenogenesis
#### Unfertilized eggs develop into a new individual (can be male or female).
Facultative parthenogenesis: Female can produce offspring either sexually or asexually.
Obligate parthenogenesis: organisms exclusively reproduce through asexual means.
#### Thelytoky
##### Unfertilized eggs develop into female.
#### Apomictic Parthenogenesis
##### Unfertilized eggs develop into offspring genetically identical to mother.
