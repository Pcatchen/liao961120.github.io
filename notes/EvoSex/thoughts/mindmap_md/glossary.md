## Environmental heterogenity
### fine-grained 
a single individual is exposed to several environments, and this exposure always occurs as a temporal
sequence. The fitness impact of an environmental state must be a function not only of the
genotype and that state, but also of the past environments to which the individual
has been exposed and their fitness impacts.

### coarse-grained
Fitness is a function of the genotype and the realized environmental state in
which the genotype is expressed.
