## Interests and Motivation <img src="/assets/images/me-about.png" style="width:20%;float: right;" class="ori"/>

I'm a psychology major strongly interested in human evolution, particularly the interaction between culture and biological evolution, which I believe have led to some of the most distinctive features of human psychologies. This interest has driven me to study a range of interesting subjects in addition to psychology, such as **Prehistory & Archaeology**, **Cultural Anthropology**, **Linguistics**, **Genetics**, **Ecology**, and **Evolution**. It has also given me an insight about the importance of transmitting skills, knowledge, and experience to others in our societies.

Aside from my interest in human evolution, I'm also a big fan of R, a statistical programming language. I approached R in a quite different way from others, particularly, the main forces that drove me to learn R was [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): I was fascinated by R's ability to create **beautiful things**. You can take a look at my [work](./work.html) to have a better understanding of what I'm talking about. BTW, if you're interested in learning R and also read Chinese, you can take a look at my post [我的 R 學習歷程](/2018/01/31/RlearningPath.html), which contains some useful information about learning R.


## Posts & Language

This is a place where I share my notes and some personal experience on learning. You can read my post, [Why Start a Blog?](/2017/11/26/why-start-a-blog), to have a better understanding of my incentive.

Some of the posts were written in Chinese, and some in English. I'm not a native speaker of English, so please bear with the grammatical errors if you encountered any.
I write my post about R in English when I want to get it published on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com), or when I want to practice my English writing skills.
It's pretty sad we don't have a platform like [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com) in Taiwan. If there is one, I would be writing more about R in Chinese.

#### **Theme Template**

The theme of my blog is [jekyll TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme), and some customization has been done to fit my own tastes. **TeXt theme** is by far the best theme I've seen (according to my tastes), the typeface and clean layout make it comfortable when reading the blog.
