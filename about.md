## Interests and Motivation <img src="/assets/images/me-about.png" style="width:20%;float: right;" class="ori"/>

I'm a psychology major strongly interested in human evolution, particularly the interaction between culture and biological evolution, which I believe have led to some of the most distinctive features of human psychologies. This interest has driven me to study a range of interesting subjects in addition to psychology, such as **Prehistory & Archaeology**, **Cultural Anthropology**, **Linguistics**, **Genetics**, **Ecology**, and **Evolution**. It has also given me an insight about the importance of transmitting skills, knowledge, and experience to others in our societies.

#### **Theme Template**

The theme of my blog is [jekyll TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme), and some customization has been done to fit my own tastes. **TeXt theme** is by far the best theme I've seen (according to my tastes), the typeface and clean layout make it comfortable when reading the blog.
