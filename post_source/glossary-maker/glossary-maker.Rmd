I was thinking about creating a glossary in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and found out that there was already an [issue](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/199) about it. I like Yihui's [recommendation](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/199#issuecomment-246888361): use Pandoc's [definition lists](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists).<!--more-->
This was exactly what I had been doing, but I quickly found out that there was a major drawback -- the definition lists **won't order alphabetically unless written in that way**.

So I wrote an R function to reorder the definition lists written in R Markdown. Note that this functions **only works for R Markdown files containing defintion lists exclusively**. If the R Markdown files aren't whole-definition-lists, the function will fail.


## Usage

To order the definition lists alphabetically, simply put the Rmd file path in the function. To have a different output file, provide the output file path as the second argument.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
sort_def_list("glossary.Rmd")
# sort_def_list("glossary.Rmd", "reordered.Rmd")
```

The output in PDF looks like this (I used the `multicol` package)[^source]:
