# Biography

I'm a psychology major strongly interested in human evolution, particularly the interaction between culture and biological evolution, which I believe have led to some of the most distinctive features of human psychologies. This interest has driven me to study a range of interesting subjects in addition to psychology, such as **Prehistory & Archaeology**, **Cultural Anthropology**, **Linguistics**, **Genetics**, **Ecology**, and **Evolution**. It has also given me an insight about the importance of transmitting skills, knowledge, and experience to others in our societies.

Aside from my interest in human evolution, I'm also a big fan of R, a statistical programming language. I approached R in a quite different way from others, particularly, the main forces that drove me to learn R was [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): I was fascinated by R's ability to create **beautiful things**.
