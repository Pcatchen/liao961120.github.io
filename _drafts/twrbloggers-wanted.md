Born and grown up in Taiwan, I speak Mandarin and write in (traditional) Chinese for most of my life. I sometimes feel sad when I have some interesting ideas about R and want to share with others -- I can either choose to write a post **in English** to get it published on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) or write it in Chinese and probably nobody except me will ever read it.<!--more-->

I often choose to write in English to gain a wider audience (including some readers of **R-bloggers** from Taiwan), but things get awkward if the post is about technical things related to **Chinese**, such as how to painlessly knit Chinese R Markdown documents to PDF, performing Chinese word segmentation in R, a new R package about [批踢踢](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTT_Bulletin_Board_System) text mining, etc. When this happens, I may choose to write in Chinese, not getting it published on **R-bloggers**. But more often, I *just don't write anything* because I know few will ever read it (and benefit from it) while writing a post costs me a substantial amount of time. **This is the time when I feel sad**. 

## No Stage for R Bloggers in Taiwan

There are a lot of R users in Taiwan, but there is no such platform like **R-bloggers** in Taiwan. I sometimes surf the web and find plenty of posts about R (in Chinese) scattering across different blogs. When I look deeper in the blogs, I often find the blogs not updated for quite a while. I guess most of the bloggers stopped writing because they lacked time and audience. They just don't have the motivation to maintain their blogs. 

The [atmosphere of blogging in Taiwan](https://data.leafwind.tw/platform-weakness-of-chinese-writer-in-medium-and-importance-of-localization-aa1e33174c42)[^blogging] isn't as strong as the western world. I think this partly results from lacking a good platform -- a platform for writing blog posts while at the same time advertising these posts. I appreciate how **R-bloggers** works. Platforms like **R-bloggers** may serve as a motivation to write blog posts, especially in places such as Taiwan where Facebook is the dominant source of new information for many people.


## **R部落客**: R-bloggers for Taiwan

Using RSS feeds to retrieve blog posts from R blogs all over the world is a clever idea, so is using social networking services (Twitter & Facebook) to advertise new posts. I think these are the two main reasons why **R-bloggers** is so successful.

Inspired by **R-bloggers**, I recreated one [using GitHub (Pages) and Travis-CI](https://github.com/Rbloggers). The resulting platform, **[R部落客](https://rbloggers.github.io)** [^rbloggers], works just like **R-bloggers**, except that it is dedicated for users and bloggers who read and write in traditional Chinese.

### Join Us

Currently, **R部落客** is in its maturing stage and needs support. We are looking for R users and bloggers who read and write in traditional Chinese. 

- If you are an R user, you can follow **R部落客** via its [Facebook fan page](https://www.facebook.com/twRblogger). 

- If you happen to write blog posts about R in traditional Chinese, I believe **R部落客** will be a great platform to advertise your work. You can read more about how to join **R部落客** [here](https://rbloggers.github.io/join.html).



[^rbloggers]: *R部落客* is *R-bloggers* in traditional Chinese.
[^blogging]: *Microblogging* doesn't count here.
