Being a Taiwanese who speaks Mandarin and writes in Chinese during most of my life, I sometimes feel sad when I have some interesting ideas about R and want to share with others. I can either choose to write a post **in English** to get it published on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) or write it in Chinese and probably nobody except me will ever read it.<!--more-->

I often choose to write in English to gain a wider audience (including some readers of **R-bloggers** from Taiwan), but things get awkward if the post is about things mostly related to **Chinese**, such as how to painlessly knit Chinese R Markdown documents to PDF, performing Chinese word segmentation in R, a new R package about [批踢踢](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTT_Bulletin_Board_System) text mining, etc. When this happens, I will write in Chinese, not getting it published on **R-bloggers**. But more often, I *just don't write anything* because I know few will ever read it (and benefit from it) while writing a post costs me a substantial amount of time. **This is the time when I feel sad**. 

## No Stage for R Bloggers in Taiwan

There are a lot of R users in Taiwan, but there isn't a platform like **R-bloggers** in Taiwan. I sometimes surf the web and found plenty of posts about R (in Chinese) scattering across different blogs. When I look deeper in the blogs, I often find the blogs not being updated for a long time. I guess most of the authors stopped writing posts because they lacked time and audience. They just don't have the motive to maintain their blogs. I'm lucky in that I can write in English to reach audience in the western world, but as mentioned above, this often makes me give up writing posts about things that only Chinese R users cares.

## R-bloggers for Taiwan: *R部落客*

Using RSS feeds to retrieve blog posts from R bloggers all over the world is a really clever idea, so is using social network (Twitter & Facebook) to advertise new posts. I think these are the two main reasons why **R-bloggers** is so successful.

I implemented the ideas of **R-bloggers** using GitHub Pages and Travis-CI, creating **[R部落客](https://rbloggers.github.io)**, a platform just like **R-bloggers** but dedicated for R bloggers and users from Taiwan.
Currently, **R部落客** is in its maturing stage and needs new R bloggers who write in Traditional Chinese to join us.
